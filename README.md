# 🛒 Amazon Clone – Frontend Web Development Project

## 📘 Overview
This project is a **basic Amazon Clone frontend**, created as part of our **college practical lab exam**.  
It demonstrates the use of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to design and build a simple yet responsive e-commerce interface inspired by Amazon’s homepage.

## 💡 Background
I recently attended a **Hackathon at NIT Delhi**, where I learned advanced frontend technologies such as **React, TanStack Query, TypeScript, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS**.  
For this project, however, I wanted to revisit the fundamentals by creating something **purely with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript** to strengthen my core skills.
